        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Myles Barney and I am excited that you are here!  I am a student at BYU studying 
		  computer science and global business.  My dream is to leave a lasting impact on the world through
		  innovative new technology and software.  My current project is OneGlobe, a social media platform
		  focused on creating meanginful interactions between people from different cultures, different countries,
		  and different mindsets, all over the world! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I had the opportunity to live in Taiwan for two years as a missionary for my church. During
		  that time I grew to love the people of Taiwan and made many lasting friendships that continue to
		  make a difference in my life. I hope that through OneGlobe others will have the same opportunity to
		  reach out and discover the complex lives of people all over the world!  
        </p>
        <p>
          Only by knowing others can we truly come to know ourselves.
